# 👋 Hi, I’m Stephen

I’m a Marine Corps veteran turned IT professional with a deep passion for cybersecurity, system administration, and technology that supports real-world impact. After nearly a decade serving as a 0481 Basic Landing Support Specialist, I transitioned into IT, where I bring leadership, critical thinking, and mission-focused precision to every project.

## 👀 I’m interested in:
- Cybersecurity & threat detection  
- Systems/network administration  
- Human-Computer Interaction (HCI)  
- Cloud technologies and virtualization  
- Veteran advocacy in tech and education  
- Web development and UI/UX best practices  

## 🌱 I’m currently learning:
- Advanced cybersecurity concepts through my BS in IT (Cybersecurity focus) at UCF  
- Frontend/backend integration using tools like Supabase, GitHub Pages, and VS Code  
- JavaScript, Python, and PowerShell scripting for automation and web functionality  
- Real-world application of HCI principles in team-based development projects  

## 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Open-source tools that help military veterans transition into tech careers  
- Web apps that promote learning, accessibility, or family storytelling  
- Projects focused on data security, DevSecOps, or system hardening  
- Collaborative UI/UX projects with a human-centered design approach
